# Authentiq

Welcome to the Authentiq WordPress plugin repository on GitHub. Here you can browse the source, look at open issues and keep track of development.

If you are not a developer, please use the [Authentiq plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/authentiq/) on WordPress.org.

# Build assets

For building the assets for the plugin you need to install `gulp`. For doing this run `yarn` or `npm install` from the plugin directory.

After this running `gulp` will build your assets once. For active development, you can use `gulp watch` instead.
